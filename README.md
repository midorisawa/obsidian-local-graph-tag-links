# Local Graph Tag Links

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that fixes a bug in the built-in local graph where notes connected through shared tags are not shown.

## The problem

When **Show Tags** is enabled in the local graph, Obsidian renders tag nodes but deliberately stops BFS traversal at them — so notes that share a tag with the current note never appear, regardless of the depth setting. This plugin monkey-patches the graph engine to continue traversal through tag nodes.

## What it does

The plugin wraps Obsidian's internal graph engine prototype to intercept the subgraph data just before it reaches the renderer. It then runs its own BFS pass seeded from every tag node already in the graph, injecting:

- **Notes that share a tag** with any tag node in the subgraph
- **Forelinks and backlinks** of those injected notes (respecting the *Forward links* / *Back links* toggles)
- **Unresolved links** (notes that don't exist yet), including their backlinks
- **Tags** of injected notes (when *Show Tags* is on), which can themselves be expanded further

All of this respects the configured **Depth** slider, mirroring Obsidian's own weight/depth scheme so nodes appear at the correct distance from the center note.

## Usage

1. Install the plugin and enable it in **Settings → Community plugins**.
2. Open the local graph for any note (**More options → Open local graph**, or via the command palette).
3. In the local graph filter panel, enable **Show Tags**.
4. Notes connected through shared tags will now appear at the appropriate depth.

All existing local graph filters and toggles (*Forward links*, *Back links*, *Show non-existing files*, *Depth*) continue to work as expected.

## Installation

### Manual

1. Download `main.js` and `manifest.json` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Lumyo/obsidian-local-graph-tag-links/releases).
2. Copy them into `<your vault>/.obsidian/plugins/local-graph-tag-links/`.
3. Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin under **Settings → Community plugins**.

### Using BRAT 

[BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) lets you install plugins that aren't yet in the community directory.

1. Install **Obsidian42 - BRAT** from the Community Plugins directory.
2. Open **Settings → BRAT** and click **Add Beta plugin**.
3. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/Lumyo/obsidian-local-graph-tag-links`
4. Click **Add Plugin**, then enable it under **Settings → Community plugins**.

BRAT will also notify you of future updates automatically.

### From source

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lumyo/obsidian-local-graph-tag-links.git
cd obsidian-local-graph-tag-links
yarn install
yarn build
```

Copy the resulting `main.js` and `manifest.json` into your vault's plugin folder as above.

## Compatibility

- Tested against **Obsidian 1.12+**
- Works on desktop and mobile
- Uses internal Obsidian APIs that are not part of the public plugin API — may break on major Obsidian updates
